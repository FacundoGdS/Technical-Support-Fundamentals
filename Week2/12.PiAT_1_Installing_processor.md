# Putting It All Together: Part 1
## INSTALLING THE PROCESSOR

21 minutes video.

>Now that we've learned what the computer components are and how they work we're going to assemble our very own computer, a full size desktop (...) Knowing how to build a computer is a skill that can be useful in lots of interesting ways.

### Ground up build:
<sub>'Ground rules' could be translated into Spanish as 'Reglas de juego'</sub>

<sub>From the very beginning; also, completely, thoroughly. For example: 'We've had to learn a new system from the ground up'</sub>

We should think about **Electrostatic Discharge** and try **to prevent unwanted static from harming our very expensive components**. Have you ever rubbed yourself socks on a carpet and then accidentally zap someone? That's pretty harmless, **but if you that to your new motherboard, you completely destroy it** [It's very sensitive].

**How do we prevent static discharge?** We can go about this in two ways...

- We can touch in our two devices that's plugged in but not powered on. FYI, you should do this every couple of minutes when assembling a new computer.
- Another option is to wear an **anti-static wristband** like the one I have here, let me get it.

You connect the end of the clip to a **non-painted metal surface** like your computer. And then you separate on to your hands and voila your done.

![Anti static wrist band](https://www.gamingscan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/anti-static-wrist-strap-how-to-use.jpg)

While we are on the subject of anti-static safety, I want to call out that when you buy computer parts, they'll come in **anti-static bags** to prevent accidental static electricity. Be sure to keep them inside the bags until you need to install them on your computer.

### Size form factor

Now, let's get making this computer, we'll start by laying down the foundation of our computer, the motherboard. Remember, there are lots of different form factors for motherboards and you want to make sure the one you purchase fits your computer case. We purchased the full size desktop cased and have a full size ATX motherboard.

On the motherboard there are a lot of **screw holes** which coincide with the holes in the desktop case too. You want to match up the holes on the motherboard to the holes on the desktop.

Also known as 'mounting holes'. ![Diagram of mounting holes](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-94a2b064f158df24602af8b6a0be6e38-pjlq)

Screwdriver doing its job through the screw holes.

Once you figure out which holes to use screw in standoffs. **Standoffs are used to raise and attach your motherboard to the case**.

![Example of standoffs](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716Xj4KmmFL.jpg)

>In this instance our case has built in standoffs.

## Adding the CPU component

>Let's start by adding our components in. We'll start with the CPU, so let's take that out of our anti-static bag. You want to be very careful with these because they're very expensive, and you don't want to drop them.

**Once we've taken out the bag, let's line up the CPU with the motherboard's socket**. Something to note is this marker right here.

![Example of CPU aligned](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19121-01/sf.x2200m2/820-3270-13/figures/index-18.gif)

This has to align with the CPU socket on the motherboard (**in one way, which is indicated and showed by these hint marks**).

**Also don't forget to make sure you get compatible CPU that fit your motherboard. We have a _LGA CPU_ and an LGA-compatible motherboard socket**. So let's go ahead and align the correct orientation of the CPU and secure it in place like this. Make sure that the pointers on the CPU and the socket are aligned.

The easy part is putting the CPU in. The fun part is securing this, just note that when you secure the CPU in the socket you do need to use a bit of force so it's tightly secured in.

**Now that our CPU is in place we need to add our Heat Sink on top of it**. The heat sink is used to dissipate heat from our CPU. I want to show you some cool things. This part right here, this is what our CPU relies on to stay cool. It takes the heat from there and then uses this **Fan** to blow it out.

![Heat sink](https://www.sunpower-uk.com/files/2014/07/Heat-Sink.png)
![Fan cooler](https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/cooler3.jpg)

**_Before we attach the heat sink_**, we need to apply an even amount of **Thermal Paste**. Thermal paste is used to better connect our CPU and heat sink. So the heat transfers from to the other better.

![Thermal paste](https://www.newegg.com/insider/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ThermalCompound2.jpg)

>To get started, apply a dab of thermal paste and spread evenly with a flat object. Lets do that on our CPU right here.

![Spreaded with flat object](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81648YU91gL.jpg)

Just make sure that it spread evenly throughout the CPU. You may have to do this multiple times to get this correct.

Okay, so once you have that in place, you're going to take your heat sink and then you're going to press it against the CPU. And something to note is that these screws right here, they align with the CPU socket. So that can guide you while you put the heat sink on.

So one thing to do, is to make sure that you screw the opposite sides first so you know that the heat sink is attached securely.

![Putting and pressing the Heat Sink against the CPU](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5qczGR4KMnY/maxresdefault.jpg)

>**Plug this Molex to the motherboard.** This is important because this is what controls the fan speed via the motherboard.

![Molex fan connector](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WqEreKGYL._SL1500_.jpg)

Perfect. So now, you've fully installed and connected your CPU to the motherboard.

## Adding the RAM component

Next, let's install our RAM. Located **DIMM** slots on your motherboard. I have four slots available here and I have four RAM sticks (...) So, as I mentioned before, this build, we're going to use **DDR3 RAM**.

All right, one thing I like to do before I install my RAM is to **make sure that I align these slots with my RAM slots** so that way I'm not going to be forcing those in when it's time to install. So, if you see right here, your slots are right in the middle so something I do is before I put it in, just visually make sure that you got this right and then align the rest of your RAM sticks to the same position like this. You just want to go like this.

![DDR3 ram slots](https://i.imgur.com/cL3q4XI.jpg)
(The design can change)

**Line up the pins correctly and push in the RAM until you hear it click**. You'll know it's secure when both sides of the RAMs are locked in place. And there's something else you should know. **Your slots right here, they are both black and white**.

## Hard drive component

In this example, we're using an SSD SATA hard drive instead of a HDD.

We just need to use one SATA cable to connect it to our motherboard.
Reproduce el video desde :11:3 y sigue la transcripción11:03
So, first, I'm going to go ahead and slot this in this cage
Reproduce el video desde :11:9 y sigue la transcripción11:09
This is going to vary from case to case, but this one's going to be easy. All we have to, we just slide it in like so. And normally you will hear a click, [SOUND] Like that. Once that's in, we just need to use one SATA cable to connect our SSD to our motherboard. Let me go and get that.
Reproduce el video desde :11:29 y sigue la transcripción11:29
So here we go. Here's a SATA cable. So what I'm going to do, is I'm going to connect this end to our SSD.
Reproduce el video desde :11:37 y sigue la transcripción11:37
I'm going to connect this end to our motherboard.
Reproduce el video desde :11:47 y sigue la transcripción11:47
There we go, it's in.
Reproduce el video desde :11:50 y sigue la transcripción11:50
Remember, SATA cables can only go in one way. So now that we have our SSD installed, let's go ahead and install our case fan.
Reproduce el video desde :12: y sigue la transcripción12:00
And this is how this looks like. One thing to note is the small x. You're going to go ahead and find a label on your motherboard that says, rear fans.
Reproduce el video desde :12:11 y sigue la transcripción12:11
Not all motherboards have this, but in this example, we do have that, so just to note.
Reproduce el video desde :12:19 y sigue la transcripción12:19
We get those into the grooves, there you go. My fan's installed, and now I'm going to go ahead and attach this to the Molex.
Reproduce el video desde :12:32 y sigue la transcripción12:32
There we go, now my fan is attached to my motherboard.
Reproduce el video desde :12:36 y sigue la transcripción12:36
For best practice, you want to create a wind tunnel that takes in air, blows it over your components, and then pushes it all out back. Check out how our heat sink has a fan on it too. That's pretty normal, since our CPU generates a lot of heat, and we want to help cool it off as best as we can.
Reproduce el video desde :12:54 y sigue la transcripción12:54
We're almost done. Now, we're going to connect our power and test to see if everything's working. So let's grab our power supply.
Reproduce el video desde :13:2 y sigue la transcripción13:02
Here we are.
Reproduce el video desde :13:6 y sigue la transcripción13:06
First, let's secure our power supply to our case. Be careful not to damage the motherboard when you install it.
Reproduce el video desde :13:13 y sigue la transcripción13:13
What you're going to do is you're going to put this in slowly like that, And then just slide it in. There you go. One thing I like to do, is I'd like to put my cables all the way out to the side, so like I mentioned before, it's not going to go ahead and damage the motherboard. So now, I'm going to go ahead and start securing our power supply.
Reproduce el video desde :13:37 y sigue la transcripción13:37
Its always fun getting in. There we go
Reproduce el video desde :13:49 y sigue la transcripción13:49
So as you can see, I normally like to go and start with my fingers, so it's easier to get in.
Reproduce el video desde :13:54 y sigue la transcripción13:54
And once I put all my screws in, I'm going to go ahead and use my screw driver and fasten it, tighten that.
Reproduce el video desde :14:19 y sigue la transcripción14:19
There you go. So let's go ahead and tighten our screws right here. [INAUDIBLE] And four. Great. So now, we've secured our power supply to the case so it's not going to move anywhere. And just another note, you can also install the power supply before adding it to the motherboard, depending on how your case is laid out.
Reproduce el video desde :14:47 y sigue la transcripción14:47
Lets go back to our mess of connectors.
Reproduce el video desde :14:51 y sigue la transcripción14:51
There are a few things I would like to highlight.
Reproduce el video desde :14:55 y sigue la transcripción14:55
This big one right here, this is the one that powers our motherboard.
Reproduce el video desde :15:1 y sigue la transcripción15:01
Another one that we have, it's more of a legacy one is this four pin Molex. These connectors were used heavily before SATA came out.
Reproduce el video desde :15:9 y sigue la transcripción15:09
Now, we use these connectors to power majority of the SATA devices today.
Reproduce el video desde :15:17 y sigue la transcripción15:17
Most modern machines today will probably use SATA power connectors for your hard drives so that it may come with Molex to SATA adapters. Now, it's time for the fun part. First, let's go ahead and connect our power supply to our motherboard. So that's this big pin as we discussed earlier. It's going to go in right here.
Reproduce el video desde :15:40 y sigue la transcripción15:40
And plug that in like so.
Reproduce el video desde :15:45 y sigue la transcripción15:45
Next, we're going to go ahead and power the CPU, with this A pin Molex right here. It's [INAUDIBLE] pretty tight, but you should be able to get it in.
Reproduce el video desde :16:5 y sigue la transcripción16:05
There you go. So what we just did was we have the power supply that is powering the motherboard and the CPU. So now that we've hooked up the cable to our CPU and motherboard, the next thing that we need to hook up are these cables that are sitting in our case. This is going to vary from case to case, but let's go through it. Some of these cables are used for your case's buttons and lights. So for this one, I'm going to plug these in.
Reproduce el video desde :16:44 y sigue la transcripción16:44
Okay.
Reproduce el video desde :17:4 y sigue la transcripción17:04
Okay, so our case cables are now secured to our motherboard. One good idea is sometimes your motherboard will come with some guides. This will help you fasten your cables to your motherboard so it's clean and tight on your case. I'm just going to go ahead and do that right here.
Reproduce el video desde :17:25 y sigue la transcripción17:25
Now that we have our cables securely fastened to our case, let's don't forget one more thing, our graphics card.
Reproduce el video desde :17:32 y sigue la transcripción17:32
We'll need that so that we can upload video to our monitor. We're going to plug this graphics card into our PCI-Express slot on our motherboard.
Reproduce el video desde :17:41 y sigue la transcripción17:41
Just like the RAM, you are going to put a little bit of pressure when you insert this in. So don't feel bad by putting a little bit of pressure and you'll hear a click like this.
Reproduce el video desde :17:54 y sigue la transcripción17:54
Once you've done it, you can tightly secure it to your case. This is going to vary from case to case.
Reproduce el video desde :18:3 y sigue la transcripción18:03
And there you go, your graphics card has been installed. All right, I think that's it. Let's cover up our computer.
Reproduce el video desde :18:11 y sigue la transcripción18:11
First make sure you take your anti-static brace right away.
Reproduce el video desde :18:17 y sigue la transcripción18:17
Get our case.
Reproduce el video desde :18:24 y sigue la transcripción18:24
Put that in like so, and just plug, and that's it.
Reproduce el video desde :18:35 y sigue la transcripción18:35
There you go, we finally built our machine. Last but not least, let's connect our monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the desktop. So first, let's get our keyboard. What we're going to do is we're going to connect this USB to the USB port on our desktop.
Reproduce el video desde :18:53 y sigue la transcripción18:53
Then we'll going to get our mouse, do the same thing. Connect this to our USB port.
Reproduce el video desde :19:1 y sigue la transcripción19:01
And then finally we're going to go ahead and connect our monitor. For this monitor, we're going to go ahead and use a display port cable. I want to connect one end to our desktop, like so. Next, I want to plug this into my monitor.
Reproduce el video desde :19:28 y sigue la transcripción19:28
All right, this is the most interesting part. Let's see if all this works.
Reproduce el video desde :19:33 y sigue la transcripción19:33
So I'm going to power it on.
Reproduce el video desde :19:37 y sigue la transcripción19:37
I got a blue light, which is good. And of course it's going to vary from system to system. Let's see if something shows up on the monitor.
Reproduce el video desde :19:46 y sigue la transcripción19:46
So computer is booting up.
Reproduce el video desde :19:49 y sigue la transcripción19:49
Let's see, okay it looks like the monitor is receiving signal, which is good. There we have messages, success, there we go, it's working, perfect. If you're having issues with your computer not starting up, that's okay. Check that your power supply can supply the correct amount of wattage or make sure your connectors are in the right place.

What's this? Non-system disk or disk error, replace and strike any key when ready. It looks like our disk doesn't have an operating system to boot into, no worries. That's what we'll be discussing in the next set of lessons. We'll learn what an operating system is and what the main operating systems are and how to install one. Well good job, you've got your computer up and running and the monitor is receiving signal, so that's it. Let's take a moment and think about what you just did, not only did you learn about each component of a computer, but you figured out how they work individually and then we built one together. It's quite an accomplishment. For your next assignment, we build a widget that will let you assemble a computer digitally, putting all the different parts together or if you have all the computer parts already, you can assemble one in real life and then write a short review process of how you did it. If you get stuck, don't worry, go back and review the different videos covering the various components. I know you can do it. I've had lots of fun teaching you all about hardware and don't worry, we'll meet again soon when you make it to the system administration IT infrastructure services course. Next up, my good friend, Cindy Quach, is going to introduce you to operating systems. Operating systems are absolutely essential in IT considering that without them none of this hardware we've discussed would be able to accomplish anything. Tell Cindy I said hi.
