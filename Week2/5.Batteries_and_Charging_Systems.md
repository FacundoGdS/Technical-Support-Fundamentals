# Batteries and charging systems, the plus of mobile devices

Sometimes instead of being plugged into a power outlet all the time, we want to take our technology with us.
Mobile technology uses rechargeable batteries to carry power with the device, wherever we take it.
Rechargeable devices might have:
- An external charger for a removable batteries.
- Or might have a cradle stand or wireless charger (without cable).

So rechargeable devices might have an external charger or removable battery, or might have a cradle stand or wireless charger.
Look at this phone (wireless charger). We're going to top up the battery just by laying it on this wireless inductive charging pad.
Isn't that cool? It's also pretty clever technology.

## Lifespan / Lyfe Cycle :recycle:

Rechargeable batteries have a limited lifespan which is measured in charge cycles. **Charge cycle is one full charge and discharge of the battery**.
When a battery is reaching the end of its lifespan, **it may take longer to charge and _might not hold as much charge as when it was new_**.

â–  For some devices, compare the current cycle count of your battery with the rate at cycle count of that battery type to see how much more life 
to expect out of it.

You need an external power source to add power to a battery. **This could come from a wall outlet, another battery, or even a solar panel**.

You also need a **charging circuit that manages the power transfer from the external power source to the rechargeable battery**.
This circuit works a lot like a Power Supply Unit or **PSU**, that we looked at earlier.
It makes sure the input power is converted to the correct output power.

Instead of using a large PSU, rechargeable devices use more portable power adapters, power supplies, or chargers.
**A portable power supply, powers our device while also charging the battery**. This might sound obvious, but you need to make
sure that you use the right charger for the right device.

**[ ! ] Mismatching chargers to devices can damage the battery, the device, and the charger**.

A lot of chargers and power supplies use USB connectors, but you'll see a wide variety of charging connectors.

### Environments conditions :zap: :sweat_drops: :fire:

Rechargeable batteries can be damaged by very cold or very hot environments. Don't charge or discharge rechargeable batteries unless
they're within their safe operating temperature range. It's not just that a damaged rechargeable battery might not perform well,
it can also be very dangerous. Batteries can swell, rupture, and sometimes even catch fire.

Before working with a damaged battery, you should know how to safely handle it. You'll find some supplemental readings after this
video that explains how to safely handle **lithium :radio_button: ion batteries, _which is a very common type of rechargeable battery_**.
Safe handling procedures vary based on the battery type, so be sure to read up on proper procedures before you work with a damaged battery.

### End of lifespan

When a battery reaches the end of its life, you'll need to replace it. Some devices will slow themselves down when a battery is getting old,
to make the battery lasts longer. If your device is running much slower than usual or shutting down unexpectedly, one thing to check is the battery life.
Some devices have batteries that are designed to be replaced by the end user, other devices have batteries that are very difficult to replace like
small laptops and mobile devices.

**As an IT support specialist, you might receive special training on how to replace batteries and devices that you support, or you might be the person
sending the device out for battery replacement and then returning the device to the end user**.

IT support specialist often have to troubleshoot battery life and device charging.

> The first step is to make sure the charger, the battery, and the device, are all designed to work with each other :ballot_box_with_check:.

We'll talk about sending out devices for repair and troubleshooting skills in future videos, so stay tuned.
For iOS and Android, there are also some things that you could do to make the battery lasts as long as possible.
It's a good idea for you to be familiar with these things so that you can help educate end users on the best ways to get the most out of their
mobile devices.
