# Power Supplies (Supplementary reading)

In this reading, you will learn how to select the correct power supply for a personal computer (PC) to support the main components of the PC.

As you learned in a previous video, computer systems require a direct current (DC) of electricity to operate. However, power companies
deliver electricity in alternating currents (AC). AC power can damage the internal components of a computer. To solve this problem,
computer power supplies are used to convert the AC from the wall socket to DC. Power supplies also reduce the voltage delivered to the
computerâ€™s internal components.
