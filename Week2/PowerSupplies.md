# Components / Power Supplies

In order to get our computer to work, we need to supply power to it.

The are two types of electricity:
1. DC = **Direct Current**, which flows in one direction. => (one way)
2. AC = **Alternating Current**, which changes directions constantly. => / <= / => (alternating)

Our computers use DC so we have a way to convert AC voltage from our power company (in my case, UTE)
to something we can use. That's that our **Power Supply** does: it converts the AC we get from the
wall (electrical outlet) into **low voltage DC power** that we can use and transmit throughout our computer.

## Power supplies

Most power supplies units have a fan, which are in there. They also have voltage information just
normally listed underneath (or on the side).
1. One cable to power the motherboard.
2. Other cable, for power. 

When we talk about electricity, we can make an analogy of the pressure of water with the voltage of
electricity.
>Voltage describes the “pressure” that pushes electricity. The amount of voltage is indicated by a unit known as the volt (V),
>and higher voltages cause more electricity to flow to an electronic device. **Source: [Hioki](https://www.hioki.com/sg-en/learning/electricity/voltage.html).**

Be careful when you plug your device on an electrical outlet, because you must know the voltage that both manages.
>"So when I was on vacation, to my surprise, when I plugged in that 120 volt appliance into a 220 volt outlet, the power
>came busting through and fried my charger", says the instructor [rename him].

In a reverse case:
>"If it was the other way around, and a 220 volt appliance was plugged into a 120 volt outlet, I wouldn't have seen the same outcome.
>
>*I'll still be able to get electricity, but slowly*.

But even if it doesn't cause an immedeate damage, as burning your device, it isn't a recommendable practice: it can deteriorate the
performance of the device and eventually cause damage in the long term.

>### As a general rule, be sure to use the proper voltage for your electronics.

## Current or amperage
**Amount of electricity, and it's measured in AMPS.**
We can thinks of *AMPS as pulling electricity* as opposed to voltage, which pushes electricity.
AMPS will pull as much electricity needed, but voltage will give you just everything. 
>"Look on the back of the one of your device charges, you might see something like 1 or 2.1a. Charging a device with 2.1 amps will actually charge a device faster because it's able to put current from a 2.1 amp than a 1 amp charger".

## Wattage
**The amount of volts and amps that a device needs.**
If your power supply has too low of a wattage, you won't be able to power your computer, so make sure you have enough. This doesn't mean that if you have a large power supply, you'll overpower your computer. Power supplies just give you the amount that your system needs. It's best to error on the side of large power supplies. You can power most basic desktops with a 500 watt power supply, but if you're doing something more demanding on your computer, like playing a high-resolution video game or doing a lot of video production and rendering, you'll likely need a bigger power supply for your computer. On the other hand, if all you're doing is just browsing the Web, the power supply that comes with your computer should be fine. All kinds of issues are caused by a bad power supply. Sometimes the computer doesn't even turn on at all. Since power supplies can fail for lots of reasons like burnouts, power surges, or even lightning strikes, knowing how to diagnose power issues and replace a failed power supply is a skill every IT support specialist should have in their toolbox.
