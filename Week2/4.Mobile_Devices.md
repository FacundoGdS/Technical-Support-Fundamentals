# Mobile devices are computers too, they have:
- CPUs
- RAM
- Storage
- Power systems
- Peripherals

How are they different from a server, a desktop computer or a laptop? They're special because they're well mobile.
They're portable and usually powered by batteries.

Some mobile devices are ***general purpose*** computing devices like tablets or smartphones, other mobile devices are optimized to perform a specific set of tasks like fitness monitors, e-readers (e-books), and smartwatches.

[ Mobile devices are usually very integrated ] . Remember the systems that we showed you earlier, the components can be taken out and held in your hand.
**Mobile devices build some or all of these components together in a way that you can't take apart.** The smaller the device, the more integrated the components usually are. **The CPU, RAM, and storage, might be soldered directly to the devices motherboard**.

## SoC
Very small mobile devices use a system on a chip or SoC. **A System on a Chip packs the CPU, RAM, and sometimes even the storage onto a single chip**.

Not only our SoC is small, **they use less battery power than if those components were separated**.

### Peripherals

Even though they're small, some mobile devices use peripherals. Smartphones connect to Bluetooth headphones for example. Mobile devices can also be a peripheral. **A fitness tracker is a standalone device, but it can also be a peripheral to your smartphone**. That same fitness tracker might use a heart rate monitor as a peripheral. It's peripherals all the way down.

### Ports and conectors

Mobile devices may use standard or proprietary ports and connectors. You might need to have a specific adapter, or connector for charging a device, or connecting your mobile device to a computer. Sometimes the physical shape or the intended use of the mobile device makes a standard connection like USB a bad choice. For example, say you have a waterproof fitness tracker. If it had a Micro-USB port, that port would be damaged if exposed to water. So instead, it's designed with a custom charging interface that can be submerged underwater.

Here's some of the standard power, data, and display connector types you'll find used in mobile devices:
- USB-C
- Lightening adapter
- Mini-USB
- Micro-USB
- Micro-HDMI
- Mini-HDMI
- Mini DisplayPort

Because mobile devices are generally small and have limited access to power, they run operating systems and applications software that specifically designed to maximize their performance. We'll dive into mobile operating systems and applications in future videos.

As an IT support specialist, you might be responsible for helping in users with their mobile devices.
**This might include setup, troubleshooting, repairing, and replacing mobile devices**. Don't worry, we're going to break all of this down for you.

**[ ! ] One super important thing, mobile devices can contain a lot of personal data. Some organizations allow people to use their own personal devices for work. We call this _Bring Your Own Device_ or BYOD. You should be careful to respect people's privacy when they bring their own devices to you for help.** To know how to handle these devices is always best to refer to your organization's policy.

=> Next up, we'll take a look at how to keep these mobile devices running without being plugged into a power outlet all the time.
